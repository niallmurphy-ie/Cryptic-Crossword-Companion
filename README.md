**Cryptic Crossword Companion.**

I made this extenstion to help me improve at cryptic crosswords, and to reinforce some web development skills I've been learning. If people find it useful, I will add more websites. Suggestions and collaboration welcome.

Features:

 - Highlight crossword indicators such as anagrams, hidden words, homophones, etc.
 - Provide abbreviations and synonyms.
 - Persistent notes per clue stored in the browser.

Enjoy.
