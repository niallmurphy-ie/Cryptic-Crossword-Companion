A Cryptic Crossword Companion.

I made this to both help me get better at cryptic crosswords, and to practice some web development skills. If people like it, I will add more websites. Suggestions and collaboration welcome.

Sites supported: https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/

To build the extension from the source files:\
git clone https://github.com/niallmurphy-ie/Cryptic-Crossword-Companion.git\
cd Cryptic-Crossword-Companion\
npm install\
npm run build:prod\
In chrome, Load unpacked extenstion from the dist folder.
